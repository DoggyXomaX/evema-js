# Evema JS
### A simple logic circuit editor.
Focused on reworking the original EVEMA-2 from scratch.

## Some features
- You can evaluate module actions by Evema.Eval( "Module:Action", args )
- You can set and get values by Evema.Set( "Module:Option", value ), Evema.Get( "Module:Option" )

## TODO
- Maybe fix some module concepts like recursive inclusion
- Create a working workspace with elements
- Elements?
- Options?
- About?
- Popup Windows?
